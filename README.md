## Not familiar with Odysee?

Odysee is a blockchain-based media platform. We host all kinds of media such as images, articles, PDFs, audio files, etc., but we're best known for hosting videos. Odysee seeks to recapture the spirit of the early 2000s era internet. Rather than favouring corporate content such as late night talk shows, network television, and TV news, Odysee is a place for everyone, including independent creators.

## Prerequisites to start getty

### Node.js

- Use the favorite terminal on your system.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher (latest LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)
- Install OBS Studio, because you're a streamer. Try it on other software if you want.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the terminal in the getty folder.
3. Run this command to install the dependencies: **npm install**
4. Run the **npm run build** command to build the app.
5. Then run **npm start** or **npm run start:prod**.
6. The server will run the app with the address http://localhost:3000.
7. Open getty in your web browser and configure your widgets in admin.

**Important:** If you download an update from getty, you must repeat the installation process. In some cases, there may be new dependencies to install, so the process may need to be repeated.

## Visit getty in the browser:

1. Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/
2. Admin: http://localhost:3000/admin/status

The app's admin page has all the widget links for OBS. I recommend saving the changes on the admin page and checking that all of them are active, or the ones you need.

## How to add widgets to OBS?

1. Open the OBS Studio software.
2. Add a new "Browser Source".
3. Paste the URL of your widget: (e.g. http://localhost:3000/widgets/chat).
4. Adjust the size, position and color of each widget.
5. You're done! The widgets will appear in your stream. Let's stream!

getty's vision is to help streamers on Odysee manage their own widgets for community interaction. This opens the door to multiple options and resources never seen before. Enjoy the app and look forward to more updates in the future.

## Hosted mode (MVP)

Here it goes in "hosted" mode so you don't have to deal with the local stuff.

**Personally, it's easier on localhost, but it's up to you if you want to set up your own server.**

If you are going to host your own server, define the **REDIS_URL** environment variable to enable hosted mode and isolate your session. Without REDIS_URL, **data is stored globally** in that deployment.

Set REDIS_URL (for example, a Redis on Render) and then visit `app.getty.sh/new-session` to create your **isolated session**. You can check in `app.getty.sh/api/session/status` that `supported=true` and, after creating it, `active=true`.

**What does all this mean?**

Everything you do in the admin and API calls are stored in Redis by "namespace" based on your token, so each session is separate; widgets use the public token without exposing anything sensitive.

If you want, adjust SESSION_TTL_SECONDS to decide how long each session lasts (default 259200 seconds = 72 hours).

### Important

If you want to share your widget publicly, use the widget link and add the parameter ?token=YOUR_PUBLIC_TOKEN.

**Example:** `/widgets/last-tip?token=YOUR_PUBLIC_TOKEN`.

Anyone with that link will see the widget data in real time; you can revoke access by regenerating the public token from the dashboard.

**This is an independent project; it is not an official Odysee product.** Visit **getty's official** website for more information: [getty.sh](https://getty.sh/).
