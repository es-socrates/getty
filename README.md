## Go live on Odysee

Odysee is a blockchain-based media platform. We host all kinds of media such as images, articles, PDFs, audio files, etc., but we're best known for hosting videos. Odysee seeks to recapture the spirit of the early 2000s era internet. Rather than favouring corporate content such as late night talk shows, network television, and TV news, Odysee is a place for everyone, including independent creators.

# Do you want to use getty locally?

## Prerequisites to start getty

### Node.js

- Use your favorite terminal.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22.x (the project requires Node >=22 <23).
- Enable Corepack (included with Node) so pnpm is managed automatically by the version pinned in `package.json`:

```bash
corepack enable
node -v   # should print v22.x.x
pnpm -v   # Corepack will provision pnpm@9.12.3
```

- Optional: install pnpm manually (if you prefer not to use Corepack):

```bash
npm i -g pnpm@9.12.3
```

## Installation

1. Install OBS Studio, Streamlabs or any software of your choice.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Open the terminal in the getty folder.
4. Optional: Copy env file and adjust values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Install dependencies with pnpm (via Corepack): **pnpm install**
6. Run the **pnpm run build** command to build the app.
7. Then run **pnpm run start:prod**.
8. The server will run the app with the address http://localhost:3000.
9. Open getty in your web browser and configure your widgets in admin.

**Important:** If you download an update from getty, you must repeat the installation process. In some cases, there may be new dependencies to install, so the process may need to be repeated.

## Visit getty in the browser:

1. Welcome & landing: http://localhost:3000/ (first-time visits redirect to `/welcome` so you can choose a language and connect your wallet).
2. Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/user/<your-widget-token>`
   - After you log in with Wander Wallet, getty issues a **widget token** and stores it in the `getty_widget_token` cookie/localStorage. Subsequent visits to `/` automatically redirect to your dashboard route.
   - If a token expires or is removed, the welcome page makes it clear and prompts you to sign in again.
3. Admin: http://localhost:3000/admin/status

The app's admin page has all the widget links for OBS. I recommend saving the changes on the admin page and checking that all of them are active, or the ones you need.

## How to add widgets to OBS?

1. Open the OBS Studio software.
2. Add a new "Browser Source".
3. Paste the URL of your widget: (e.g. http://localhost:3000/widgets/chat).
4. Adjust the size, position and color of each widget.
5. You're done! The widgets will appear in your stream. Let's stream!

getty's vision is to help streamers on Odysee manage their own widgets for community interaction. This opens the door to multiple options and resources never seen before. Enjoy the app and look forward to more updates in the future.
