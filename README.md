## Not familiar with Odysee?

Odysee is a blockchain-based media platform. We host all kinds of media such as images, articles, PDFs, audio files, etc., but we're best known for hosting videos. Odysee seeks to recapture the spirit of the early 2000s era internet. Rather than favouring corporate content such as late night talk shows, network television, and TV news, Odysee is a place for everyone, including independent creators.

## Hosted mode (MVP)

You can run Getty in a hosted, multi-tenant-like mode using ephemeral tokens:

- Set REDIS_URL to enable Redis-backed session storage (recommended in Render).
- Create a hosted session by opening /new-session. This issues:
	- Admin token (stored in HttpOnly cookie `getty_admin_token`)
	- Public token (HttpOnly cookie `getty_public_token`)
- Admin API calls and settings will be stored per token namespace in Redis. Widgets can use the public token.

Environment variables:
- REDIS_URL: Redis connection string.
- SESSION_TTL_SECONDS: Optional TTL for sessions (default 259200 = 72h).

## Prerequisites to start Getty

### Node.js

- Use the favorite terminal on your system.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher (latest LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)
- Install OBS Studio, because you're a streamer. Try it on other software if you want.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the terminal in the getty folder.
3. Run this command to install the dependencies: **npm install**
4. Run the **npm run build** command to build the app.
5. Then run **npm start** or **npm run start:prod**.
6. The server will run the app with the address http://localhost:3000.
7. Open Getty in your web browser and configure your widgets in admin.

**Important:** If you download an update from Getty, you must repeat the installation process. In some cases, there may be new dependencies to install, so the process may need to be repeated.

## Visit Getty in the browser:

1) Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/
2) Admin: http://localhost:3000/admin.html/

The app's admin page has all the widget links for OBS. I recommend saving the changes on the admin page and checking that all of them are active, or the ones you need.

## How to add widgets to OBS?

1. Open the OBS Studio software.
2. Add a new "Browser Source".
3. Paste the URL of your widget: (e.g. localhost:3000/widgets/chat.html).
4. Adjust the size, position and color of each widget.
5. You're done! The widgets will appear in your stream. Let's stream!

Getty's vision is to help streamers on Odysee manage their own widgets for community interaction. This opens the door to multiple options and resources never seen before. Enjoy the app and look forward to more updates in the future.
